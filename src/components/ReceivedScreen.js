              receive a quick response code (QR Code) for use as proof of

              Health and Safety Code section 120440 and will be kept
              confidential and on file as required by law. All requested
              information is mandatory to receive a QR Code; not supplying the
              requested information will result in an inability to use DCVR.
              Please note that any and all information collected in the DCVR may
              be disclosed to the California State Auditor, the California
              Office of Health Information Integrity, the California Office of
              Information Security, or other state and federal agencies as
